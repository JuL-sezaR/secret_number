# Secret Number

This repository contains my **first-ever Rust project**
It is a simple **terminal-based guessing game** with a small twist.

You are facing a wizard who has chosen a **secret number**.  
You have **7 attempts** to guess it correctly before the game ends.

---

## How the Game Works

- The wizard chooses a random number between **1 and 1000**
- You have **7 attempts**
- After each guess, the game tells you:
  - Whether your guess is **too high** or **too low**
  - A **hint** about how close you are
- Guess the number in time to win 🧙‍♂️

- **Rust** installed (`rustc` and `cargo`)

To check:
```bash

cargo --version
```

Afterwards, make sure to clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/JuL-sezaR/secret_number.git"
Then:
